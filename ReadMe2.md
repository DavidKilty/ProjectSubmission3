* This is a straightforward Python terminal based game. Taking inspiration from a five grid based game, simimnlar to something like BattleShips.
* You play the game "crushing" the "snakes" that the opposition has places in their "pit"
* This means that, you will try and guess where the code "opposition" has placed there randomized points "snakes", on a 5 by 5 gird "pit", which you as the user cannot see.
