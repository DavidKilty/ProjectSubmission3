# The Snake Pit

* This is a straightforward Python terminal based game. Taking inspiration from a five grid based game, simimnlar to something like BattleShips.
* You play the game "crushing" the "snakes" that the opposition has places in their "pit"
* This means that, you will try and guess where the code "opposition" has placed there randomized points "snakes", on a 5 by 5 gird "pit", which you as the user cannot see.

## How To Play 

1. Guess where the computer as their snakes hidden in their pit
2. The rows are labelled 0 to 4 not 1 to 5 
3. Type in two spaced out digits, e.g: 2 3. 
4. See if you were able to guess correctly and haver crushed the computers snakes
5. Repeat until a winner is declarted!

## Features 

This is based of the popular Battle Ships game, but with an added twist. Here a few images for you to get a feel of the game.

###  Features - Exisiting Features

* Randomly generated board.

 - The board is a 5 by 5 grid but, labelled 0 to 4 (Important to remember when playing to avoid puttin in false data).
 - The user cannot see where the computer has generated the position of their "snakes" in their "pit" (obviously, as it would be much fun otherwise)

* The user plays against the comuputer 

* The python code therefor accepts data input from the user 

* The computer also keeps track of the socres.

* Validates input and checks for errors 

 - Remember earlier, use numbers 0 to 4 and not 1 to 5. The computer will only accpet numbers 0 to 4 and a number lower than 0 or higherr than 4 will return and eror message 

 - Also, the computer will only accept numbers, not letts, emoticons etc.

###  Features - Future Features 

* 

 - The board, or pit, could be extended to bigger than it currently is. 

 - Allow the user to decide where they place their snakes. 

## Testing 

I used the manual testing methods for checking my code: 

- PEP8 and checked there were no issues 
- Feeding it invalid data, outside the previosly stated bounds, to see how it responds. 
- Use my local terminal in my IED 

## Deployment
